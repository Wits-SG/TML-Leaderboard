            <p>The Magic Library is 3D puzzle game inspired by escape rooms. The player is tasked with solving a series of puzzles scattered across the library.</p>

            <p>
                The Magic Library was built as our project for our Computer Graphics course. The goal of the project was to introduce us to ThreeJS
                and higher level programming than WebGL / OpenGL but not quite at a game engine.
            </p>

            <p>Each puzzle was designed to showcase some feature or topic taught in the course, varying from shaders to graphical modelling and all things in between.</p>

            <p>
                As part of this, we put together a very rudimentary game engine built on top of 
                <a href="https://threejs.org" class="text-sky-600 hover:text-sky-800 underline">ThreeJS</a> and 
                <a href="https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js/" class="text-sky-600 hover:text-sky-800 underline">AmmoJS</a> called W3Ads (weeds).

                    <p>Every library needs a wizard, and every wizard needs an office. Wizards always havs spare bits and bobs all over the place, maybe some of the objects have a crystal hidden behind them?</p>

                    <p>Libraries need a place to pull up a chair and read some <i>magic</i> books, and nothing beats a good fireplace. Except maybe a magic fireplace, it does however need to be lit first.<p>
